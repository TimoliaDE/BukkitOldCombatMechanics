This is an extension of the original **OldCombatMechanics** plugin ([link to original repository](https://github.com/kernitus/BukkitOldCombatMechanics)).

The following options have been added to the config 
(details for each can be found in the config file):

- `no-deflect-fire-projectile`
- `old-bow-damage`
- `fix-bow-shoot`
- `old-fall-damage`
- `old-water-placement`

In addition, the default values for the following config options have been adjusted to better match Minecraft 1.8 PvP mechanics:

- `attack-frequency`
- `shield-damage-reduction`
- `old-player-knockback`
- `old-player-regen`

This plugin requires Java 21 and supports the Minecraft Java versions 1.20.2â€“1.21.8.
