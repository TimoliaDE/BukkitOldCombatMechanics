## OldCombatMechanics - Extension
This is an extension of the original **OldCombatMechanics** plugin ([link to original repository](https://github.com/kernitus/BukkitOldCombatMechanics)).

The following options have been added to the config
(details for each can be found in the config file):

- `old-projectile-trajectory`
- `no-deflect-fire-projectile`
- `old-bow-damage`
- `fix-bow-shoot`
- `old-fall-damage`
- `old-water-placement`
- `damage-inside-wall`

In addition, the default values for the following config options have been adjusted to better match Minecraft 1.8 PvP mechanics:

- `attack-frequency`
- `shield-damage-reduction`
- `old-player-knockback`
- `old-fishing-knockback`
- `old-player-regen`
- `projectile-knockback`

This plugin requires **Java 21 or higher** and supports the **Minecraft Java Edition** versions **1.20.2–1.21.10**.

### ⚠️ Important Note
Use **only** the JAR file ending with `reobf.jar`:  
**`OldCombatMechanics-v2.2.0-adapted-reobf.jar`**

Other JAR files in the `build/libs` folder do **not** work properly.
